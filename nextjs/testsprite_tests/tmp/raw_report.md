Please provide valid credentials or an alternative way to access the checkout flow to complete this testing.

#### Test TC018
- **Test Name:** Site Wide Search Functionality
- **Test Code:** [TC018_Site_Wide_Search_Functionality.py](./TC018_Site_Wide_Search_Functionality.py)
- **Test Error:** The search modal was tested with various search terms including partial terms 'event' and 'marketing', and the exact event title 'Congresso Nacional de Marketing'. In all cases, the search returned no results despite multiple relevant events visible on the homepage. This indicates the search API or backend is not returning relevant results swiftly or accurately across events, blog posts, and other site content. The search functionality is currently not working as expected and needs investigation and fixing.
